Description:
This example completes a simple block capture and saves the data from channel A to disk.
The example uses numpy to stack the data into a single array and saves it via
np.savetxt().

CSV files are not as efficient as numpy binary file (.npy). If you want to save the data
to be human-readable, CSV is a good option. If you are saving it to load into another Python
script, consider using np.save(): detailed in examples/saving_files/save_numpy.py example.

Requirements:
- PicoScope 6000E/3000E
- Python packages:
  (pip install) pypicosdk numpy

Setup:
  - Connect Channel A to the AWG output
