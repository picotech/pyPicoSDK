This example sets up the PicoScope as a single channel digital multimeter.
It measures the DC output of the SigGen and prints the average voltage of a single capture.
No trigger is used in this example (None/Free).

This example uses advanced block capture, to reduce setting up the buffer multiple times.

Setup:
    - Connect channel A to SigGen output.
