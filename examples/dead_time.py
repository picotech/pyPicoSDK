This example displays the dead time between consecutive rapid block captures using a
PicoScope. The script configures a signal generator to output a square wave, sets up a
single-channel capture with a trigger, and collects multiple captures in rapid succession.
It then retrieves trigger timing information to calculate and plot the dead time between
captures.

Setup:
 - Connect Channel A to AWG Output

Notes:
 - Pico examples use inline argument values for clarity
